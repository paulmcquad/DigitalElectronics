# Digital Electronics - S1 EP2 (Logic Gates)

## Introduction: What's a Logic Gate?

Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system.

It is an electronic circuit having one or more than one input and only one output.
The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic.

We will look at the most common logic gates and their truth tables:
