## Introduction: What's a Number System?

Simply put, a number system is a way to represent numbers. We are used to using the base-10 number system, which is also called decimal.

Other common number systems include base-16 (hexadecimal), base-8 (octal), and base-2 (binary).

## Binary - Base 2

Binary means two. In this numbering system only two digits are allowed, 0 and 1. Digits 2 to 9 are not allowed.

## Octal - Base 8

Octal means 8.. In this numbering system only 8 digits are allowed, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7.. Digits 8 and 9 are not allowed.

## Decimal - Base 10

The decimal numbering system uses ten different characters (Digits).0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

## Hex - Base 16

Hexadecimal means 16. In this numbering system 16 digits are allowed, we use all the ten digits of the decimal system plus A,B,C,D,E,F.
The sixteen digits in this system are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,,A,B,C,D,E,F.

## The sign magnitude system

In the sign magnitude system the left-most bit is called the sign bit and the other bits are the magnitude bits (see below & see pg 17 - Numsys.doc)

## The 1’s complement system

Another way of representing negative numbers is the 1’s complement system. Positive numbers are represented the same way as positive sign magnitude numbers. (see pg 17 - Numsys.doc)

## The 2’s complement system

In the 2’s complement system positive numbers are represented in the same way as the 1’s complement system and as the sign magnitude system. Negative numbers are represented by changing the ones to zeros and the zeros to ones and adding one. (see pg 17 - Numsys.doc)

## Binary-coded decimal (BCD)

In computing and electronic systems, binary-coded decimal (BCD) is a class of binary encodings of decimal numbers where each digit is represented by a fixed number of bits, usually four or eight. Sometimes, special bit patterns are used for a sign or other indications (e.g. error or overflow).

### Other Number Systems

There's also Base 32 and Base 64 and so on.
